<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Obie Rodriguez, for the past 12 years I've been a sales professional in online automitive retailing but in the past four,
   in SaaS HR Technologies. The exposure to the tech industry sparked a new found interest in data and software projects, thus reflects my ambition to delve into the world of technology and innovation.
  <br><br>
 In my spare time, you can find me exploring my creative side through art, enjoying the harmonies of music,
    or savoring a good craft beer. My loyal companion, Nova, a 4-year-old husky, adds joy and excitement to my life.
  <br><br>
  I'm drawn to projects that carry a meaningful mission and offer opportunities to tackle
   obstacles head-on. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of overcoming a challenge
    and finding solutions. I'm excited to embark on this new journey in Software Engineering and
     continue pushing boundaries to make a positive impact.
